Dear Friends and Colleagues,

Subject: announcing WEB+AF8-LRL

We would like to invite you to look at the web site we are developing. It is still 
in an early phase, but what is there is functional. The intent of WEB+AF8-LRL is to
increase the availability of software we have written over the years that deals with
unit cells/lattices and their transformations and properties.

It's still early days, so we would like to hear about issues you might find. There
are still a few known problem areas, but letting us know when you find them
can help us resolve them.

Except for one program, they all take the same kind of unit cell input,
and most write output that can be used to input to another program. The
site facilitates such chaining together of the programs. 

All of the program source (including the web site) are open source 
software, freely available to all.

We will appreciate your feedback should you find this useful. Your
comments and suggestions for additions and for error correction 
will be gladly welcomed.
