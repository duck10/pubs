Dear Friends and Colleagues,

Subject: announcing WEB_LRL

We would like to invite you to look at the web site we are developing.
http://blondie.arcib.org:8083/+AH4-yaya/lrl_web/

It is still in an early phase, but what is there is functional. The intent 
of WEB_LRL is to increase the availability and visibility 
of software we have written over the years that deal with
unit cells/lattices and their transformations and properties.

It's still early days, so we would like to hear about issues you might find. There
are still a few known problem areas, but letting us know when you find them
can help us resolve them.

Except for one program, they all take the same kind of unit cell input,
and most write output that can be used to input to another program. The
site facilitates such chaining together of the programs.  (That one program
simply generates data for other programs to use.)

All of the program sources (including the web site) are open source 
software, freely available to all.

We will appreciate your feedback should you find this useful. Your
comments and suggestions for additions and for error correction 
will be gladly welcomed.

Although the site is easily used without help, we are attaching a
summary of information about the individual commands available and
also a short tutorial. Like the web site, these are still works-in-progress.

With our best wishes,
Herbert J. Bernstein
Lawrence (Larry) C. Andrews
