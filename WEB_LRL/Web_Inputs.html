<strong>LRL_Web Data Inputs:</strong><br>

<strong>General Input:</strong> <br> 
 There are 5 types of input lines. Except for "END", they can be combined in any order.<br> 
All these are case-insensitive. If a particular input lattice is invalid, it is rejected with a message.<br><br>
--- RANDOM: Produces random (valid) unit cell;<br> 
--- Crystal lattice input: "A", "B", "C", "P", "R", "F", "I" followed by three axis lengths and three angles (in degrees);<br> 
--- semicolon: lines beginning with a semicolon are treated as comments<br> 
--- END ends the data input section<br><br> 
<strong>Vector Input:</strong> <br> 
--- g (or g6) for G<sup>6</sup>vectors; <br> 
--- s (or s6) for S<sup>6</sup>, Delone/Selling scalars,<br> 
--- c3 (or C3) for C<sup>3</sup> input (without parentheses or commas) (C would be interpreted as a C-centered unit cell)<br>

--- C3 input is in the order: (s1,s4), (s2,s5), (s3,s6) where the elements are the S<sup>6</sup> Delone scalars.<br>

--- u (or U or DC7u or DU) for unsorted Dirichlet 7 cells.<br> 
<br> 
<strong>Examples of unit cell inputs</strong><br> 
F 10 20 30 90 90 90<br> 
G 100 400 900 0 -215.02 0<br> 
S6 0 -107.51 0 7.51 -400 -792.49<br> 
random<br>
C3 (0.000,-100.000) (0.000,-100.000) (0.000,-100.000)<br> 
; this is a comment<br> 
end<br>

<br><strong>Invalid Input:</strong><br>
The most common invalid input is an invalid unit cell, entered either as a cell or a vector.<br>
If an unrecognized lattice symbol or word is used, then a message is output.<br>
Here are a few examples:<br>
--- randoq<br>
--- p 10 10 10 120 120 121<br>
--- S6 100 100 100 -90 -90 -90<br>
