Why is reduction as is Niggli-reduction or Selling-Reduction or Minkowski-reduction called reduction.  What is being made smaller?

Edit
In crystallography and lattice theory, these "reduction" algorithms are called "reduction" because they systematically make the lattice basis vectors smaller and more orthogonal - they're reducing the lengths of the basis vectors and the angles between them to find a more canonical, minimal representation.

Specifically, what's being made smaller:

Vector lengths: The algorithms work to find shorter basis vectors that still span the same lattice. Instead of using arbitrarily long vectors, they find the shortest possible vectors that can serve as a basis.

Non-orthogonality: They reduce the angles between basis vectors, making them as close to perpendicular as possible. This is measured by reducing the off-diagonal terms in the Gram matrix (the matrix of dot products between basis vectors).

Lattice parameters: In crystallographic terms, they're finding the unit cell with the smallest possible lattice parameters (a, b, c, α, β, γ) that still represents the same crystal structure.

The term "reduction" comes from this process of systematically shrinking these quantities to their minimal values while preserving the mathematical properties of the lattice. It's analogous to reducing a fraction to its simplest form - you're finding the most compact, canonical representation.

Each algorithm has slightly different criteria for what constitutes "reduced":

Minkowski reduction: Focuses on finding the shortest possible basis vectors
Niggli reduction: Uses specific conditions on lattice parameters to ensure uniqueness
Selling reduction: Based on reducing a quadratic form associated with the lattice
The goal is always to transform an arbitrary lattice basis into a standardized, minimal form that's easier to work with and compare across different representations of the same lattice.

Very interesting, thanks for sharing.Fixed!Thanks for the tip!
