<p><strong><font size="4" style="font-size: 15pt">LRL_Web: About this
web site</font></strong></p>
<p>We would like to invite you to look at the web site we are
developing.<br/>
http://blondie.arcib.org:8083/+AH4-yaya/lrl_web/<br/>
<br/>
It
is still in an early phase, but what is there is functional. The
intent of <b>WEB_LRL</b> is to increase<br/>
the availability and
visibility of software we have written over the years that <br/>
deal
with unit cells/lattices and their transformations and
properties.<br/>
<br/>
It's still early days, so we would like to
hear about issues you might find. There are still a<br/>
few known
problem areas, but letting us know when you find them can help us
<br/>
resolve them.<br/>
<br/>
Except for one program, they all take
the same kind of unit cell input, and most write<br/>
output that can
be used to input to another program. The site facilitates such
<br/>
chaining together of the programs. (That one program simply
generates data <br/>
for other programs to use.)<br/>
<br/>
All of
the program sources (including the web site) are open source
software, freely available to all.<br/>
We will appreciate your
feedback should you find this useful. Your comments and suggestions
for additions <br/>
and for error correction will be gladly
welcomed.<br/>
<br/>
Although the site is easily used without help,
we are attaching a summary of information about the <br/>
individual
commands available and also a short tutorial. Like the web site,
these are still <br/>
works-in-progress.<br/>

<strong><font size="4" style="font-size: 15pt">A
short essay about unit cells</font></strong></p>
<p>Crystals are magical-looking things that have interested people
since prehistory.<br/>
A moment's thought tells you that there is
something special about the way that<br/>
they are constructed.
Crystallographers are women and men who study the structures<br/>
of
crystals. The structures are usually described in terms of the &quot;unit
cell&quot;,<br/>
the building block that when stacked up makes the
crystal. 
</p>
<p>Unit cells are usually thought of as boxes and described by the
length&amp;apos;s of their<br/>
edges and the angles between them.
The problem that arises is that there are different<br/>
choices of
how to define the unit cell of a crystal, some as simple as
interchanging the<br/>
edges (and there are other, more complex
choices). <b>WEB_LRL</b> is designed to allow&lt;<br/>
access to some
programs that can show such choices and to display some
information<br/>
about the lattices and the relationship between
different choices and cells. 
</p>

<p><strong><font size="4" style="font-size: 15pt">Different ways to describe a unit cell</font></strong><br/>
<p>
<b>WEB_LRL</b> is designed to give access to several different ways that cells are described.<BR>
The different ways are briefly described below. Programs in <b>WEB_LRL</b> are designed to provide<br>
for the transformations between the types. It does this by providing the ability to read<br>
the data from the input window for each type (except V<sup>7</sup>).
