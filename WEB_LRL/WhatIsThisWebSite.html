<strong style="font-size: 25px;">LRL_Web: About this web site:</strong><br>
<p>We would like to invite you to look at the web site we are
developing.<br/>
http://blondie.arcib.org:8083/+AH4-yaya/lrl_web/<br/>
<br/>
It
is still in an early phase, but what is there is functional. The
intent of <b>WEB_LRL</b> is to increase<br/>
the availability and visibility
of software we have written over the years that <br/>
deal with unit
cells/lattices and their transformations and properties.<br/>
<br/>
It's
still early days, so we would like to hear about issues you might
find. There are still a<br/>
few known problem areas, but letting us
know when you find them can help us <br/>
resolve them.<br/>
<br/>
Except
for one program, they all take the same kind of unit cell input, and
most write<br/>
output that can be used to input to another program.
The site facilitates such <br/>
chaining together of the programs.
(That one program simply generates data <br/>
for other programs to
use.)<br/>
<br/>
All of the program sources (including the web site)
are open source software, freely available to all.<br/>
We will appreciate your feedback should you find this useful. Your comments
and suggestions for additions <br>
and for error correction will be gladly welcomed.<br/>
<br/>
Although the site is easily used without help, we are attaching a summary of
information about the <br> 
individual commands available and also a short tutorial. Like the web site, 
these are still <br>
works-in-progress.<br/>
<br/>

<strong style="font-size: 25px;">A short essay about unit cells:</strong><br>

<p>
Crystals are magical-looking things that have interested people since prehistory.<br>
A moment's thought tells you that there is something special about the way that<br>
they are constructed. Crystallographers are women and men who study the structures<br>
of crystals. The structures are usually described in terms of the &quot;unit cell&quot;,<br>
the building block that when stacked up makes the crystal.
</p>
<p>
Unit cells are usually thought of as boxes and described by the length&apos;s of their<br>
edges and the angles between them. The problem that arises is that there are different<br>
choices of how to define the unit cell of a crystal, some as simple as interchanging the<br>
edges (and there are other, more complex choices). <b>WEB_LRL</b> is designed to allow<<br>
access to some programs that can show such choices and to display some information<br>
  about the lattices and the relationship between different choices and cells.
