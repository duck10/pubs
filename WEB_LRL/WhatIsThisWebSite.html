<h1>LRL_Web What is on this web site</h1>

We would like to invite you to look at the web site we are developing.<br>
http://blondie.arcib.org:8083/+AH4-yaya/lrl_web/<br><br>

It is still in an early phase, but what is there is functional. The intent 
of WEB_LRL is to increase<br>
 the availability and  visibility of software we have written over the years that <br>deal with
unit cells/lattices and their transformations and properties.<br><br>

It's still early days, so we would like to hear about issues you might find. There
are still a<br>
 few known problem areas, but letting us know when you find them can help us <br>resolve them.<br><br>

Except for one program, they all take the same kind of unit cell input, and most write<br>
 output that can be used to input to another program. The site facilitates such <br>
 chaining together of the programs.  (That one program simply generates data <br>
 for other programs to use.)<br><br>

All of the program sources (including the web site) are open source 
software, freely available to all.<br><br>

We will appreciate your feedback should you find this useful. Your
comments and suggestions for additions and for error correction 
will be gladly welcomed.<br><br>

Although the site is easily used without help, we are attaching a
summary of information about the individual commands available and
also a short tutorial. Like the web site, these are still works-in-progress.<br><br>
