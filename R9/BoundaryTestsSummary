Summary of R9 Embedding Boundary Test Results

Test Configuration:

Six boundaries tested, corresponding to each S6 parameter (s1 to s6) crossing zero
For each boundary, two points were tested:
a. Inside point: si = -0.01 (others unchanged)
b. Outside point: si = 0.01 (others unchanged)
Outside points were reduced back into the fundamental region


Embedding Process:

Both inside and outside points were embedded into R9 space
Euclidean distances between embedded points were calculated


Numerical Results:

Consistent distance observed across all six boundaries: 0.0458
This distance was identical for all boundaries tested


Key Observations:
a. Consistency: The identical distance (0.0458) across all boundaries demonstrates uniform behavior of the embedding at different S6 boundaries.
b. Small, Non-zero Distance: The distance is small but non-zero, indicating that the embedding successfully captures the minor difference between points on either side of a boundary.
c. Continuity: The small, finite distance suggests a smooth transition across boundaries, implying continuity of the embedding.
d. Symmetry: The uniform results across all six boundaries indicate that the embedding treats all S6 parameters equivalently, preserving the symmetry of S6 space.
Precision and Stability:

The consistent four-decimal place precision (0.0458) suggests numerical stability in the embedding and distance calculations.


Boundary Handling:

The results confirm that the embedding correctly handles the reduction step when a point crosses outside the fundamental region.


Scale Sensitivity:

The embedding demonstrates appropriate sensitivity to small changes (0.02 in S6 parameters resulting in a distance of 0.0458 in R9 space).



These results validate several important properties of the R9 embedding:

It maintains continuity across S6 space boundaries.
It preserves the local structure of S6 space near its boundaries.
It handles the reduction of points outside the fundamental region correctly.
It provides a consistent representation across all boundaries of S6 space.

The uniform and small distances observed in these tests indicate that the R9 embedding successfully captures the essential topological and geometric properties of S6 space, particularly at its boundaries. This makes the embedding well-suited for applications involving lattice comparison, analysis of structural transitions, and other crystallographic studies where accurate representation of lattice relationships is crucial.
