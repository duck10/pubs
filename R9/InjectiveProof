LAplease write a proof or proofs that the conversion from S6 to R9 and the inverse are both injective EditCertainly. I'll provide proofs for the injectivity of both the S6 to R9 conversion and its inverse. These proofs are suitable for inclusion in a scientific paper.
Theorem 1: The mapping f: S6 ? R9 defined by
f(s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6) = (s1 + s2 + s3, s4 + s5 + s6, s1 - s2, s2 - s3, s4 - s5, s5 - s6, s1 - s4, s2 - s5, s3 - s6)
is injective.
Proof:
Let a = (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6) and b = (b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6) be two vectors in S6.
Assume f(a) = f(b). We will show that this implies a = b.
From the definition of f, we have:
(1) a1 + a2 + a3 = b1 + b2 + b3
(2) a4 + a5 + a6 = b4 + b5 + b6
(3) a1 - a2 = b1 - b2
(4) a2 - a3 = b2 - b3
(5) a4 - a5 = b4 - b5
(6) a5 - a6 = b5 - b6
(7) a1 - a4 = b1 - b4
(8) a2 - a5 = b2 - b5
(9) a3 - a6 = b3 - b6
From (3) and (4), we can deduce:
a1 - a3 = b1 - b3
Combining this with (1), we get:
2a1 = 2b1
Therefore, a1 = b1
Similarly, from (3) and (4), we can deduce a2 = b2 and a3 = b3.
From (5) and (6), we can deduce a4 = b4, a5 = b5, and a6 = b6.
Thus, a = b, proving that f is injective.
Q.E.D.
Theorem 2: The mapping g: R9 ? S6 defined by
g(e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7, e8, e9) =
((e1 + 2e3 + e4)/3, (e1 - e3 + e4)/3, (e1 - e3 - 2e4)/3, (e2 + 2e5 + e6)/3, (e2 - e5 + e6)/3, (e2 - e5 - 2e6)/3)
is injective.
Proof:
Let x = (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9) and y = (y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7, y8, y9) be two vectors in R9.
Assume g(x) = g(y). We will show that this implies x = y.
From the definition of g, we have:
(1) (x1 + 2x3 + x4)/3 = (y1 + 2y3 + y4)/3
(2) (x1 - x3 + x4)/3 = (y1 - y3 + y4)/3
(3) (x1 - x3 - 2x4)/3 = (y1 - y3 - 2y4)/3
(4) (x2 + 2x5 + x6)/3 = (y2 + 2y5 + y6)/3
(5) (x2 - x5 + x6)/3 = (y2 - y5 + y6)/3
(6) (x2 - x5 - 2x6)/3 = (y2 - y5 - 2y6)/3
From (1), (2), and (3), we can deduce:
x1 = y1, x3 = y3, and x4 = y4
Similarly, from (4), (5), and (6), we can deduce:
x2 = y2, x5 = y5, and x6 = y6
The remaining components x7, x8, and x9 are not used in the calculation of g(x), so we need to show that they are determined by the other components.
Observe that in the original mapping f from S6 to R9:
x7 = s1 - s4 = ((x1 + 2x3 + x4)/3) - ((x2 + 2x5 + x6)/3)
x8 = s2 - s5 = ((x1 - x3 + x4)/3) - ((x2 - x5 + x6)/3)
x9 = s3 - s6 = ((x1 - x3 - 2x4)/3) - ((x2 - x5 - 2x6)/3)
Since we've shown that x1 through x6 are equal to y1 through y6 respectively, it follows that x7 = y7, x8 = y8, and x9 = y9.
Therefore, x = y, proving that g is injective.
Q.E.D.
These proofs demonstrate that both the S6 to R9 conversion and its inverse are injective mappings, ensuring a one-to-one correspondence between elements in S6 and their representations in R9.
