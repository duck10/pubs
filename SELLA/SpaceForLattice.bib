  journal = {J. Sov. Math.},

  number = {1},
  abstract = {The principal achievement of Bravais - the separation of lattices
	into 14 types and the derivation of the so-called Bravais parallelepipeds
	for these types [32] -- had an immense significance for the whole
	of geometric crystallography. This work can be put into line with
	such notable achievements as the derivation of the 32 crystal classes,
	47 simple forms, and 230 spatial groups. At the present time 4-dimensional
	and n-dimensional crystallography are being strongly developed, which
	are now difficult to construct on the basis of the elementary-geometric
	considerations used in 3-dimensional crystallography. The basis method
	in n-dimensional crystallography today is the so-called arithmetic
	method, i.e., the application of finite groups of integral matrices.
	The most important application of this method was, in its time (1948),that
	by Zassenhaus [54] who showed that if all the nonequivalent n-dimensional
	groups of integral matrices are known for any n, then all the n-dimensional
	Fedorov groups are now obtained automatically. But at the present
	time (1971), the German scientists Wondratschek, Neub~ser, and B~low
	have obtained by this method the far from- easy-to-get solution to
	the problem of 4-dimensional Bravais types of lattices [34, 47, 53].
	In the present paper we dwell in detail only on those aspects of
	the arithmetic method which are directly connected with Bravais'
	papers. At the end we give two further directions in the development
	of the arithmetic method, one of which is connected with the use
	of the so-called perfect polytope of Voronoi [6], while the other,
	particularly important as far as we are concerned, is connected with
	the analysis of the absolute region of reduction. In conclusion the
	authors can report with satisfaction on the recent great achievement
	of Ryshkov who, using the methods described, found once again all
	the 4-dimensional Bravais types as well as the Bravais types of 5-dimensional
	lattices.},
